                <p>Hello! My name is Aziz, and I’m 17 years old. Currently, I’m studying IT at Stockport College, where I’m learning a lot about technology and computer systems. I have a strong passion for computer science, which inspires me to dive deeper into the world of coding and technology. Alongside my academic pursuits, I also have a keen interest in mathematics, as I love solving problems and exploring new concepts. When I’m not studying, you’ll likely find me at the gym, staying active and challenging myself physically. These are just a few of the things I’m passionate about, and I’m excited about where they’ll take me in the future!
